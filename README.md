# Family Photography Campaign - 2025  

Welcome to my photography repository! I'm excited to incorporate new techniques as I build this website. The goal is simple: to showcase my family photography work and the experience I gained since 2018 when I began working for my first agency. Over the past year, I've been booking clients month-to-month, which has been quite a head ache lol. This website will inform interested clients about my prices, open dates and my personal photographic style from an editor's perspective.

## Showcase  

In addition to simple descriptions of my services, I'm thrilled to showcase a few standout images from previous sessions.  

## Target Campaign Date

The upcoming campaign will run from **December 2024 through around March 2025**. I’ve carefully chosen six preferred locations for family photography, ensuring consistent colors and tones throughout all galleries.
