# **Family Photography Campaign - 2025**  

Welcome to my photography repository! I'm excited to incorporate new techniques as I build this website. The goal is simple: to showcase my family photography work and the experience I gained since 2018 when I began working for my first agency. Over the past year, I've been booking clients month-to-month, which has been quite a headache lol. This website will inform interested clients about my prices, open dates, and my personal photographic style from an editor's perspective.

## **Showcase**  

In addition to simple descriptions of my services, I'm thrilled to showcase a few standout images from previous sessions.

## **Target Campaign Date**  

The upcoming campaign will run from **December 2024 through around March 2025**. I‚Äôve carefully chosen six preferred locations for family photography, ensuring consistent colors and tones throughout all galleries:  

- **Gilroy**: Scenic parks and rustic settings.  
- **San Jose**: Urban and natural blends.  
- **Morgan Hill**: Serene countryside.  
- **Hollister**: Timeless rural backdrops.  
- **San Juan Bautista**: Historic and cultural beauty.  
- **Palo Alto**: Sophisticated cityscapes and lush parks.

## **A/B Test: Time-Based Personalization**

### **Purpose**

To enhance user engagement, the "About" section dynamically updates content based on the visitor's local **time of day**.

| **Time Range**       | **Personalized Content**                                      |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Morning** (5-11 AM) | Title: "Good Morning! Start Your Day with a Smile" <br> CTA: "Book a Morning Session" |
| **Afternoon** (12-5 PM) | Title: "Good Afternoon! Make Memories Last Forever" <br> CTA: "Book an Afternoon Session" |
| **Evening** (6-11 PM) | Title: "Good Evening! Preserve the Golden Hour" <br> CTA: "Book an Evening Session" |

### **How It Works**

- **JavaScript** dynamically detects the user's current hour and updates:  
  - Title text  
  - Description content  
  - Call-to-action button text  
  - Section image (e.g., morning, afternoon, or evening themes)  
- Content is tailored to the time of day for maximum contextual relevance.  

### **Key Features**  

- **Dynamic Updates**: No page reload required, smooth and seamless transitions.  
- **Engagement Focus**: Personalized messaging improves click-through rates (CTR).
